// Package theme is the shared visual language of the Sneat, DataTug and FileTug
// terminal applications: colours, card framing, and chrome (bars, composer
// frame, panel rows) that every product renders through, so all of them look
// and behave alike with no styling code of their own. The chat surface of
// strongo/aichat and the navigation shell and widgets of strongo-tui draw
// exclusively with it.
//
// The package was born in strongo/aichat as tui/theme and moved here so that
// aichat depends on strongo-tui and not the other way round.
//
// Founder ruling (2026-09-25): "UI styling should be unified across apps.
// Message should be like a card in chat of any app." and (same day,
// follow-up): "Same for composer block and hints status bar and top menu
// and side panel." DataTug chat's look (pkg/chat/chatui.go's topBar/
// statusBar/renderMarkdown and its transcript entry styling) was the
// reference; this package is where that look now lives, as the DEFAULT —
// a product supplies only CONTENT (title, hint labels, menu items, message
// text); every colour, border, and padding decision lives here, once.
//
// No other package should construct a lipgloss.NewStyle() with a
// hard-coded colour literal — read a colour or a render helper from here
// instead, so changing the look means editing this one package.

// disappears for the rest of the line. This was a real regression twice
// over: the composer's filled background vanished right after the input's
// own cursor-cell reset, and a side panel row's background vanished the
// same way. fillSGR/paintOver below are the fix: reassert (bg, fg)

// --- cards ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Founder ruling (2026-09-25, REPLACING the earlier bordered-card design):
// "There is unnecessary border around message card and grid. The card

// generally." A card is a FILLED BACKGROUND BLOCK, never a box-drawing
// border — a role's background tint (colorsFor) IS the card, with inner
// padding and a bold header line inside the fill. Focus/selection (no
// border to thicken) instead SHIFTS the whole fill to
// FocusSurfaceColors() and adds a 1-column left accent bar in FocusColor()
// — the bar is the non-text focus indicator (>= nonTextMinRatio against
// the surrounding background; see the contrast section below), the
// background shift is the reading cue. Grids are the one exception (see
// tui/grid) — a grid keeps its own drawn border, title/footer inline in
// the border, and a scrollbar in the right border, with NO card fill
// around it (transcript's SelfFramed capability skips the Card wrap for
// it entirely).

// CardPaddingCols/Rows is the space, in columns/rows, kept between a
// card's fill edge and its content.

// transcript show at most 10 data rows (default; make it a theme/

// achieves both at once, see chatshell's View()), and a single blank row
// between the last transcript card and the composer. SUPERSEDED, r12
// (founder, verbatim, seeing the rendered result in Warp): "status line
// should have top margin ... It should be last line on screen" — a THIRD
// blank row now separates the composer from the hints/status bar too (the
// r9 "NO blank row" rule is dropped), and the status bar itself is pinned
// to the terminal's own last row, nothing rendered below it. All three
// blank rows collapse to zero below MarginCollapseRows terminal rows, so a
// short terminal never loses transcript space to decoration.

// are readable" — made measurable, not eyeballed. Every (foreground,
// background) combination this package actually paints together is named
// below (ContrastPairs) and checked by TestContrastMeetsWCAG, for BOTH
// Dark variants, against the thresholds a colour change can never
// regress silently:
//
//   - body text (message text, grid cells, side-panel rows, hint labels)
//     on its actual background, and selected/highlighted row text on the
//     selection background: >= bodyTextMinRatio (WCAG AA normal text).
//   - a focus border/accent against its surrounding background:
//     >= nonTextMinRatio (WCAG AA non-text contrast) — a border only
//     needs to be DISTINGUISHABLE, not read as text.
//   - "muted" text (MutedColor) is read at the SAME bodyTextMinRatio as
//     any other text — lower emphasis MUST come from weight/saturation,
//     never from dropping below the text threshold. placeholderMinRatio
//     exists for the one deliberate exception a product's OWN placeholder
